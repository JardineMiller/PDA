#PDA Software Development: 
###Project Unit, Level 8

**FlixRating Project**

There are many conflicting opinions as to which films are the best from each generation, with critics and audiences often giving very different responses when asked about the greatest films of all time.

You will make a website that will answer once and for all the question **“Which are the best films of each decade of film-making?”**

The website will ask users to choose their three favourite films from each decade since the 1960s.  It will also take in ratings from other sites such as IMDB, Rotten Tomatoes and the box office takings.  It will combine all of these sources to list the top films, grouped by decade.  

The **algorithm** for deciding the top films is up to you.  You will need to show how you decided on your final algorithm and your pseudocode for calculating this.

The core functionality is to facilitate nominations for top three films of each decade.  Your website will also be able to display the top films in each decade.

##Requirements for all projects

We value working code that meets the criteria.  The project is pass or fail only, there are no extra marks given for extra features.

Ensure you spend time planning, and reviewing your planning every day. The assessors will want to see your first ideas of what you hoped to achieve to compare to your final product and your iterative approach to development. 

Read through the project evidence checklist carefully.  You will need to create and show all of the pieces of evidence on this list.

Git commit regularly. Every time you have some working code, commit, and push to a remote repo (Github). That way, any problems will only be a short step from the working code, and it will be easier to get help to determine the cause.

The project should be your own work.  You will need to collaborate with others to gather requirements but all other work, including the software development plan, must be your own
