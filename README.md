#PDA Repository

This repository contains all the resources and information that CodeClan students need to access as part of the SQA Professional Development Award in Software Development.

The following is an explanation of what the folders within this repository contain.

> Back-up project brief

This is a back-up project that is for those who do not have enough evidence from the projects that have been completed over the duration of the 16 week course. This project can be built to meet the requirements for the project unit.

> Cognitive test revision notes 

These are all the notes needed as part of the revision for the cognitive tests. The cognitive tests are part of the Learning Objectives for the Analysis and Design as well as the Implementation and Testing units. Students should use these resources to revise for the tests.

> PDA lessons

These are the lessons that are given to students over the 16 week course as part of the PDA prep, as well as assistance with general project planning. Guidance on various diagrams (formatting, minimum requirements, etc.) can be found in these lessons.

> Testing Exercises

These are the testing exercises listed on the Implementation and Testing checklist that students are given at the start of the course. 
IMPORTANT: Students should download the testing exercises to their computers and follow the directions and complete the exercises. The exercises should be saved in the PDA folder they created on their desktop in the first week. These will be collected by the Assessorâ€™s using a USB.

> Student Checklists

These are electronic copies of the checklists that are handed out to students over the 16 week course as part of the evidence gathering that is required. Students will be given paper copies at appropriate points on the course.
