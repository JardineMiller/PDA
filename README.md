#PDA Repository

This repository contains all the resources and information that CodeClan students need to access as part of the SQA Professional Development Award in Software Development.

The following is an explanation of what the folders within this repository contain.

> Back-up project brief

This is a back-up project that is for those who do not have enough evidence from the projects that have been completed over the duration of the 16 week course. This project can be built to meet the requirements for the project unit.

> Cognitive test revision notes 

These are all the notes needed as part of the revision for the cognitive tests. The cognitive tests are part of the Learning Objectives for the Analysis and Design as well as the Implementation and Testing units. Students should use these resources to revise for the tests.

IMPORTANT: Students will complete these tests under exam conditions at a set point in the course. You will be advised by the instructors at what point these will be completed. These resources do not have to be read until indicated by the instructors.

> PDA lessons

These are the lessons that are given to students over the 16 week course as part of the PDA prep, as well as assistance with general project planning. Guidance on various diagrams (formatting, minimum requirements, etc.) can be found in these lessons.

> Policies and Procedures

These are the documents that must be read by the student in order to agree with processes that the Professional Development Award follows. None of these documents need to be printed or completed by the student, just read.

> Testing Exercises

These are the testing exercises listed on the Implementation and Testing checklist that students are given at the start of the course. 

IMPORTANT: Students will complete these exercises later in the course. Do not complete these exercises until they have been explained and introduced by the instructors.

> Student Checklists

These are electronic copies of the checklists that are handed out to students over the 16 week course as part of the evidence gathering that is required. Students will be given paper copies at appropriate points on the course.
